# AI in Health Technologies (ELEC-E8739) — Aalto University

This repository contains my implementations for the assignments of the course **ELEC-E8739: AI in Health Technologies D**, held during the **Fall 2025** semester at **Aalto University**.

**Instructor:** Prof. Aleksei Tiulpin, PhD.

## 📌 Repository Overview

The coursework focuses on applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to real-world clinical problems, ranging from tabular data analysis to advanced medical image segmentation.

### 📂 Directory Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:

* **`assignment1/`**: Machine Learning Fundamentals.
* **`assignment2/`**: Medical Image Classification.
* **`assignment3/`**: Medical Image Segmentation.
